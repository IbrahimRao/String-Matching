# String-Matching


String Matching with KMP Algorithm
This repository contains a C++ program for string matching using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm. The code is designed to find a specific pattern within a text and determine whether the pattern exists in the given text or not.

Usage
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the number of the test case you want to run.

The program reads the test cases and search data from the p1_input.txt file and processes them.

It then uses the KMP algorithm to search for the specified patterns within the text.

Finally, it prints "True" if the pattern is found in the text and "False" otherwise.

You can define multiple test cases with their respective patterns.
